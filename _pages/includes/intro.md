# About Me

My name is Chengxin Liu. I am a Ph.D. student supervised by Prof. [Zhiguo Cao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=396o2BAAAAAJ) at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). 
I also work closely with Prof. [Hao Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ly2qWWgAAAAJ).
Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from HUST.

My research interests include computer vision and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on **learning with noisy labels** and its applications on **dense prediction tasks**, e.g., object detection, object counting, and segmentation.
