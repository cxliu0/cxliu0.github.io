# About Me

My name is Chengxin Liu. I received my PhD degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), advised by Prof. [Zhiguo Cao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=396o2BAAAAAJ) and Prof. [Hao Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ly2qWWgAAAAJ).
Before that, I got my bachelor's degree from HUST.

My research interests include computer vision and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on 
* **Data-efficient learning** (e.g., learning with noisy/unlabeled data),
* **Dense prediction** (e.g., object detection, object counting, and segmentation),
* **Generative models**.
